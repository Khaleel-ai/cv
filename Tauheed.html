    <h1>Tauheed</h1>
    <p>Tauheed is to single Allah out alone with what is specific to Him. Its parts are three:</p>
    <p>1. Tauheed Ar-Rubobiyyah (To single Allah out with Lordship.)</p>
    <p>2. Tauheed Al-Ulohiyyah (To single Allah out in His sole right to be worshipped).</p>
    <p>3. Tauheed Al-Asmaa was Sifaat (To single Allah out in His Names and Attributes).</p>

    <h3>Tauheed Ar-Rubobiyyah</h3>
    <p>This part of Tauheed is to single Allah out with His actions from creating, providing, managing the afffairs, etc.</p>
    <p>Nobody rejected this category of Tauheed. As far as the Athiests, their rejection of this Tauheed is only done out of arragance. For they know, with certainty, within themselves that Allah is the Creator.</p>
